Hello, I'm Kang Wichan!
I currently work as a software developer in the Republic of Korea.

I have a deep interest in computer science, especially the field of software.
I want to write posts about software in an interesting and not overly academic way.

I enjoy productive debates that can lead to an answer.
Please feel free to share your thoughts in the comments.

Thank you for visiting.
