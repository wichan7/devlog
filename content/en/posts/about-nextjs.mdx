I recently used Next.js quite a bit for a personal project. Why Next? Well, first of all, I was bothered by intimidating statements like "Next is the future of React, you'll be left behind if you don't know it," and since the React team is actually pushing Next.js as the standard, I thought I should at least know about it.

And the Next.js I experienced firsthand was a tool with many confusing aspects.

## SSR and the Reality of Servers
When you look at articles about Next.js, most of them tout SSR and Hydration as huge advantages. This is where my first confusion came from. React is simply a tool for generating static resources, so how on earth does it do server-side rendering?

It turns out that Next builds a Node.js-based server along with the build. This Node server performs tasks like Hydration. From an infrastructure perspective, compared to React which only needed a web server like Nginx, this adds the burden of managing a WAS in between. If you don't use a platform like Vercel (which I'll mention later), managing this will be a significant cost.

## The Ambiguous Boundary Between Server and Client
The distinction between Server Components and Client Components was a cauldron of confusion.

Since SSR is supposed to be an advantage, I tried to write the source code primarily with Server Components. I used a zustand global store for theme application, but oops—Server-Side JSX and Client-Side JSX can't share state.

For something like Java + Thymeleaf, since they use different languages, the server/client distinction is natural and doesn't require this kind of understanding. But with Next, all source code is JS. While writing code, I always had to be conscious of whether this logic runs on the server or the client.

This approach felt like it was going against the trend of separating BE and FE responsibilities that has developed over time.

In the end, I removed all the supposedly advantageous server components and plastered 'use client' everywhere, returning to the familiar structure of creating and calling APIs under /api instead of SSR.


## Server Actions and Their Terrible Behavior
The most baffling thing was Server Actions. It's a way to import and use server functions from the client, and if the parameters and return values are serializable, you can use the function even inside 'use client'.

Wait, didn't you say server-side source code only runs on the server? When you create an action function, Next creates a unique value for that function and builds the client source code to execute that function as an HTTP call and return the result.

This recently scored a perfect 10 out of 10 on a security vulnerability (CVE). A hole occurred in the part where server actions serialize/deserialize using Promises, and as a result, if you inject code into the payload, you could execute a shell on the Node server that is the Next build output. It was a heavy price to pay for going against the times.


## I Hate Next
I hate Next. But I have no alternative to offer.

I've criticized it thoroughly, but what alternatives are there for React-based developers to get SSR for SEO while maintaining this level of developer experience?

Astro? Remix? I haven't tried them, so I honestly don't know. Compared to Thymeleaf and JSP that I've tasted, I'd probably use Next.

And while Next is... well... Vercel is amazing. When you create a Next project, the rich features Vercel provides are incredible. GitHub repo integration, CI/CD, DNS, Analytics, Serverless-DB—all configured with one click.

Being able to skip infrastructure setup and focus only on feature implementation is a huge advantage for hobby personal projects.
 

## Conclusion
As the common developer saying goes, there's no silver bullet in the world. At least from my perspective, Next.js was a bundle of easily misunderstood concepts and security vulnerabilities.

It's been too successful for its reputation. It seems to be marketed like a silver bullet, backed by Vercel, a well-capitalized, tightly integrated platform.

But actually, this blog was also developed with Next.

Vercel's convenience is really amazing.

There's too much magic for enterprise use, but ultimately, won't Vercel + Next, which has captured DX well, continue to dominate the small-scale development market like MVPs?
