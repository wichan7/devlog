## Overview
While implementing CRUD with Spring Boot, I modified Thymeleaf code (.html), but it wasn't reflected immediately and I had to restart to see the changes.  
Why aren't the changes reflected right away?

## Reason
Thymeleaf caches rendered pages for performance improvement.  
And even if the template is changed, it doesn't reload, so even when you modify the template, the changes aren't reflected immediately.

## What to do?
In development, you can disable Thymeleaf's cache option.  
Add the following property to `application.yml`.  
``` yaml showLineNumbers
spring:
  thymeleaf:
    cache: false
```

## DevTools Introduction
While we're at it, let's make it detect Java source changes and rebuild automatically.  
Spring Boot provides a great library called 'devtools'.

## DevTools Installation
### Add gradle dependency
``` gradle showLineNumbers
dependencies {
  compileOnly 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools'
}
```

### Modify application.yml
``` yaml showLineNumbers
spring:
  devtools:
    livereload:
      enabled: true
    restart:
      enabled: true
```

## Eclipse Settings Change
Enable `Project > Build Automatically` in the Eclipse top toolbar.
