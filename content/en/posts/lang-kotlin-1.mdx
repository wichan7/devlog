## What is Kotlin
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a language created by Jetbrains, the company famous for Intellij.
Kotlin's catchphrase is `Concise. Crossâ€‘platform. Fun`, which can be interpreted as a concise language that supports multiple platforms.

### Does it support multiple platforms?
Looking at Kotlin's official overview, `Kotlin Multiplatform` is introduced first.

Among these, I found it unfamiliar that it's used in web development, so I looked into it. In fritz2, one of the Kotlin/JS frameworks, web code is written like this:
``` kotlin showLineNumbers
// fritz2
fun main() {
    render {
        div("my-style-class") {
            h2 {
                +"Hello Peter!"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
(I'll use JS.)

Getting back to the main point, through Kotlin Multiplatform, I learned that you can achieve multiple platform services with one language.
The platforms that seem to be most used in actual projects are Android/iOS and Server (Spring).

### Is it concise?
As I'll introduce later, since Kotlin is ultimately converted to bytecode and executed by the JVM, it's often compared to Java code.
``` java showLineNumbers
// java
function main() {
    String name = "stranger";
    System.out.println("Hi, " + name + "!");
    System.out.print("Current count:");
    for (int i=0; i<=10; i++) {
        System.out.print(" " + Integer.toString(i));
    }
}
```

``` kotlin showLineNumbers
// kotlin
fun main() {
    val name = "stranger"
    println("Hi, $name!")
    print("Current count:")
    for (i in 0..10) {
        print(" $i")
    }
}
```

You can see the conciseness compared to Java standard libraries that started with package names like System.out.

## Kotlin's Build Process
![kmp](/images/lang/kotlin/complie-process.png)
JVM is a virtual machine for executing `*.class (bytecode)`.
Java is converted to *.class files by the `Java Compiler`.

Kotlin also uses JVM. Like Java, it's converted to *.class by the `Kotlin Compiler`.
This *.class is loaded by JVM's class loader along with kotlin runtime, then converted to native code suitable for each operating system, and finally the program is executed.

## Side Notes
1. In the next post, let's install and use the Kotlin Compiler.
2. Kotlin's native pronunciation is said to be 'Kotlin'.
