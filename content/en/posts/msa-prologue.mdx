## Monolithic Architecture
This is a common architecture where one (mono) application handles all tasks for a service. It's structurally simple and powerful when developing small services.

## Micro Service Architecture
This is an architecture where multiple small (Micro) applications are developed for a service. While structurally complex, it modularizes applications, resulting in low coupling and strong resilience to service failures, among other benefits that computer engineering modules naturally provide.

## What I Want to Do
I want to directly design and implement 'MSA', which is still unfamiliar to me. Given my strong interest in DevOps, I want to try many new approaches while working on this project.
