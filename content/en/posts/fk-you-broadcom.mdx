Our service is heavily dependent on Redis, making it a single point of failure. So we've set up high availability and are diligently monitoring it.  
While monitoring the cluster while drinking an iced americano as usual... I saw that two Redis nodes had died. Did Docker Hub die again? Can't it find DNS? I began the frantic hunt to find the cause.

## The Cause Found

Wait, `bitnami/redis:debian-*` can't even be pulled locally?!? I immediately went to the [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/redis) and saw...

> Starting August 28th, over two weeks, all existing container images, including older or versioned tags (e.g., 2.50.0, 10.6), will be migrated from the public catalog (docker.io/bitnami) to the "Bitnami Legacy" repository (docker.io/bitnamilegacy), where they will no longer receive updates.

Starting August 29, 2025, images previously provided from the `/bitnami` repository have been migrated to `/bitnamilegacy`.  
Of course, if you delete the `/bitnami/redis:*` tag, it can't be pulled.

## Bitnami's Explanation

> Beginning August 28th, 2025, Bitnami will evolve its public catalog to offer a curated set of hardened, security-focused images under the new Bitnami Secure Images initiative⁠. As part of this transition:

They're saying they're launching security images and discontinuing support for existing images to push this as the main offering.

Security images are provided for free. However, only the latest tag is available, so it can't be used in production.  
Security images with version tags are paid! How much? **$62,000 per year**! That's **88.6 million KRW** lol

## Why Are They Doing This?

Bitnami is a repository with such a long history that it's called a pioneer, managing famous charts like mongo, redis, postgres..., all of which are targets for monetization.  
And the reason is entirely due to Broadcom.

Broadcom is fundamentally a semiconductor company, but recently it's been showing the behavior of a Vulture Capital that acquires companies and fleeces them before leaving.  
In 2018, it acquired CA Technologies, in 2019 it acquired Symantec, and in 2023 it acquired VMWare.  
After acquisition, they've terminated permanent licenses of existing services and converted them to subscriptions, monetizing the bitnami/* open repository, showing a focus on profit generation.

Actually, since profit generation is the primary goal of corporations, Broadcom's behavior isn't completely incomprehensible.  
However, when it comes to bitnami/*, $62,000 per year isn't pocket change, and it only appears to be a sleazy attempt to extract $62,000 from companies that need quick responses, forcing them to swallow bitter medicine.

## Solution

As a quick fix, I deployed using the `/bitnamilegacy/redis:debian-*` image.  
I plan to carefully examine other charts that provide sentinel configuration.
