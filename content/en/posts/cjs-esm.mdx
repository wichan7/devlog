## Background
When trying to use 'import' statements in a Node.js project, you often encounter the error `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module`. This means you cannot use import statements outside of a module, but what is a module and why can't we use import?

## CommonJS and ECMA Script Modules
CJS and ESM are both module systems. The original JavaScript didn't have a module system, but when JavaScript started being used for backend development, the `CommonJS` module system was created and became the de facto standard.

Since CommonJS wasn't an official standard, the ECMA Script Modules module system was newly established as a standard, with different syntax and internal structure from CommonJS for utilizing modules.

* As a side note, the ESM module system and ECMAScript specification versions like 'ES6, ES7, ES8' are different things.

## Conclusion
The `type` in package.json specifies which module system the current package will use.
``` json showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "node_jwt",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  ...
}
```
When specifying `type: module`, it means you will use the 'ESM' module system, and therefore you must use module syntax that matches ESM.
When specifying `type: commonjs` or nothing at all, you use the CommonJS syntax with require() statements.

Since the import from statement I wanted to use is ESM syntax, I added `type: module` to my project.
